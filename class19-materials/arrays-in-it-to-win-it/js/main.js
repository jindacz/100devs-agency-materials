//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movie=['m1','m2','m3']

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let m1=movie[1]

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let len=movie.length
console.log(len)
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let last=movie[len-1]
console.log(last)
